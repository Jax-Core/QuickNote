## About

![QuickNote](https://images-wixmp-ed30a86b8c4ca887773594c2.wixmp.com/i/97bfd084-7ef0-496f-a835-3c41f482d38c/destwwu-0a47f2bf-547a-4ac5-809a-568a4afab9ca.png)

QuickNote is a Rainmeter skin designed to increase productivity. QuickNote allows for simple row manipulation and includes some smooth transitional animations. It also includes a built-in checklist feature for creating a to-do list. You can save your notes in one of five different slots. To summon the skin, you can also use a custom hotkey or drag from the top-left corner of your screen.

## Features

* Row Manipulation 
* Page Expandability
* 8 Different Color Schemes 
* Fluent and Customizable Animations & Styles

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Rainmeter v4.5 or newer.** Rainmeter can be installed by downloading the `.exe` file [from Rainmeter's official website.](https://www.rainmeter.net/)
- **JaxCore v40005 or newer.** JaxCore can be installed by downloading the `.rmskin` file from [JaxCore's official website.](https://jax-core.github.io/)

### Installation

Assuming you successfully downloaded and installed Rainmeter as well as JaxCore, you can now proceed to install QuickNote by following the steps below.

1. Download and run the `.rmskin` file for **QuickNote** from the official [JaxCore site](https://jax-core.github.io/) to install **QuickNote**.
2. Leave the installation settings at their defaults and click Install.
3. When the installation is finished, a startup pop-up should appear. Follow through the pop-up to finish installing QuickNote.

* Note:  If you find that the JaxCore option is red on the startup pop-up, please press the red button and Core will be installed automatically. Perchance this fails, you can manually install Core by downloading the `.rmskin` file from [JaxCore's official website.](https://jax-core.github.io/)


### Customization

QuickNote includes 8 color scheme presets. You enable them by just selecting them within the **Color Scheme** tab. These are their names:

- Dark
- Nord Light
- CoreUI
- Dracula
- Amarena
- LoveLace
- Nord Dark
- Light (Jax is currently in bad boy prison for adding this option)

You can also make your own custom schemes through the **Appearance** tab.
